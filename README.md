This project makes use of vaadin and spring boot to provide a simple and easy to use web editor for new developers to aid the beginner process
by abstracting them from SDK and language setups while also reducing the computational overhead required to get into coding.
this project makes use of docker containers on the backend to simulate different programming environments (by using their official images provided on the docker website) where user code is then executed and sent back to the end user.
